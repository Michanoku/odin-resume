# Odin Resume

This is a react app that allows the user to create a simple resume. The user can add fields and remove fields and enter their data and also provide a picture. This app was made for The Odin Project for the purpose of learning. 

## Additional thoughts

Starting out with react I had a lot of problems using it correctly and understanding everything
that was going on. I had to look up much more than I thought and it took me way longer than
anticipated. I also really neglected git while struggling with react. I realize that the 
more comfortable I am with my work, the more natural git comes to me. This is something
that needs to be improved on.
